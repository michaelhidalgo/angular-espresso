Resources
=========

This directory should be used for adding any client scripts not related to AngularJS such as front-end scripts using
jQuery or other libraries.

All scripts in this directory will be compiled into minified .js files and sent to "public/js" after a build

Note that this directory has been added to this project template for convenience, but all your client logic should be
done with AngularJS. If you are still feeling tempted to write the DOM manipulation you are used to, refer to
the "Common Pitfalls" section in the [FAQs](http://docs.angularjs.org/misc/faq) section of AngularJS.
