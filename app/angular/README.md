Angular
=======

Your AngularJS app should go in this directory.

All .coffee files in this directory will be compiled into minified .js files and sent to
"public/angular" after a build.

You can have whatever directory structure you want here, just keep in mind that these are client files.

When writing your views, refer to these files as "/angular/filename.js"

For more info, check out [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/)

You might want to read the section "A Note on Minification" in their tutorial at
